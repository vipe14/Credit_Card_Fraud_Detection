# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Random Forest Classifier
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning to detect credit card fraud using the Random Forest Classifier algorithm. It aims to build a model that can effectively identify fraudulent transactions from a dataset containing both legitimate and fraudulent credit card transactions.

# Project Overview
Objective: To develop a machine learning model for detecting credit card fraud based on transaction features.

**Data Source:** A dataset containing credit card transactions, including features like transaction amount, timestamp, and more.

**Algorithm Used:** Random Forest Classifier

# Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the credit card transaction data.
  Model Building: Training a Random Forest Classifier model on the preprocessed data.
  Fraud Detection: Applying the trained model to identify potentially fraudulent transactions.
  Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using relevant metrics.
  Visualization: Visualizing the results and fraud detection outcomes.

# Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following libraries and tools installed:

  **Python (version 3.x)
  NumPy
  pandas
  scikit-learn
  matplotlib
  Jupyter Notebook (optional)**
